## Project Exam 1

## Goal

To put into practice the skills learned over your first year of studies.

## Brief
You have been tasked with creating a blog site. You can choose the design and topics covered on the blog, but it should have at least the following pages:
-	Home page
-	Blog post specific pages


### Home Page
The home page should have a ‘Latest Posts’ section which uses a carousel (slider) for users to click to view more posts. For example, by default the user can see four posts, then they can click an arrow on the right to view the next four posts, and click it again to view the next four posts. The user can also click back to view results they had previously seen. This must be implemented for desktop at least, but if you want a simpler layout for mobile, you can change it from being in a carousel.


### Blog Specific Page

If images on the blog post page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.



## Level 1 Process

5.	Build your website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch your data.
6.	Install Hotjar on your website.
7.	Ask users to test your website, and adjust based on their feedback and any insights from Hotjar.
8.	Write a report documenting your project (template provided in this repository).
9.	Submit your report as a PDF and a link to both your Netlify deployment and your GitHub repo.
 
## Level 2 Process (optional)

1.	You can try adding a sort, filter, or search to the blog posts page allowing users to find the blog post more easily that they’re looking for. 
2.	Post the data from the contact form to WordPress so you have the details saved.
3.	Allow users to submit comments on a blog post, and post this data to WordPress
